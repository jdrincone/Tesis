\chapter*{Abstract}
This  work shows that the resonant Hawking radiation in black-hole laser (BHL) configuration is  produced by a discrete set of instabilities, whether the system a Bose-Einstein condensate (BECs) where the radiation are phonons, or if the system is light pulses propagating in optical fibers where the radiation are photons. To obtain this result, we describe the properties of a quantum field propagating in a curved spacetime, as the one generated by a black hole. This type of curvature has a region of no-return defined as an event horizon and the radiation that escapes from it is known as Hawking radiation (HR).\\

We show how the propagation of a fluctuation on a moving fluid is equivalent to the propagation of a scalar field in a curved spacetime. This result allows us to study HR in laboratory experiments on condensed matter and in optics. Then we study the dispersion relation that should follow a ground-state fluctuation of a bosonic system such as BECs through the linearization of the Gross-Pitaevkii equation. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the fluctuation that propagates on the moving fluid can be analyzed by the theory of instabilities. Then we introduce the BHL in the acoustic context and we analyze the dynamics of the fluctuation with the  theory of instabilities introduced in \cite{2018Bermudez}.\\

Later, we implement a similar formalism for optical systems, where the moving medium is created from the interaction of intense optical pulses with nonlinear and dispersive materials. We study the dispersion relation that must follow a fluctuation that propagates over a light pulse that creates the moving medium, this is achieved by linearizing the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE). We also analyzed the dynamics of the fluctuation in the  optical black-hole laser (OBHL) configuration  by the theory of instabilities. We conclude that the OBHL configuration allows light to be confined with light in a way similar to a temporal waveguide and that is also amplified to produce resonant Hawking radiation.
